		Threat model for the bananaphone obfuscation protocol

0. Abstract

   We discuss the threat model for the Bananaphone Pluggable
   Transport, its limitations, possible uses and implications for
   combining it with other protocols.

   The Bananaphone Pluggable Transport is based on the Bananaphone
   codec api written by Leif Ryge.

1. Adversary capabilities and non-capabilities

2. The adversary's goals

3. Goals of bananaphone

   The Bananaphone Pluggable Transport is meant to be combined with
   other protocols that provide integrity, confidentiality and authentication.
   Therefore in this case Bananaphone's goal is to simply represent a
   bitstream as something that looks similar to natural language. This
   could be useful if combined with a transport meant for some amount
   of natural language, for instance, HTTP.

   It is possible to extend the Bananaphone codec api to include more
   sophisticated models that more accurately mimic natural language.

4. Non-goals of bananaphone

   The Bananaphone Pluggable Transport does not provide integrity,
   confidentiality or authentication; an adversary only needs to guess
   the encodingSpec (tokenization function, hash function and bits per
   token) to see the data be transported. This encodingSpec is
   trivially detectable through frequency analysis.
