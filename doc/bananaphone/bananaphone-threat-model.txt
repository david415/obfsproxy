		Threat model for the bananaphone obfuscation protocol

			       David Stainton


0. Abstract

   The Bananaphone Pluggable Transport is based on the Bananaphone
   codec api written by Leif Ryge.

1. Goals of bananaphone

   Bananaphone's goal is to hide the Tor TLS handshake so that
   the tor connection is not detected by censorship regime's
   passive Deep Packet Inspection machines. In order for these
   machines to see that there is encapsulated tor traffic the
   bananaphone's encoding_spec must be known;
   it takes some effort to guess the correct encoding_spec.

2. Non-goals of bananaphone

   The Bananaphone Pluggable Transport does not provide integrity,
   confidentiality or authentication.
